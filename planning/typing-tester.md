# Shavian Typing Tester Discord Bot Draft

*202510301155 Spentine*

The Shavian Typing Tester Discord Bot idea is courtesy of Marty Lloyd. The architecture and design is created by Spentine.

The purpose of this program is to provide a fun method to practice reading and typing Shavian. It should be implemented in a Discord bot to encourage publicity and for ease of use. Naturally, being a Discord bot, it should implement features intended for public viewing. Examples listed below:

- Save Data
- Leaderboards
- Competitive 1v1 (*note: after the person wins, the other can copy, so there cannot be more than 2 players*)
- Profile UI

The implementation will be in Python. The source code will be in a public repository, and thus should use more modern practices. It should be relatively modular, because the typing test should only be one component of the bot. Typing functionality should be attached with an addon.
