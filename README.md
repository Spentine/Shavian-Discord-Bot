# Shavian Discord Bot (ShavBot)

*Created by Spentine Nov 1*

## Usage and Installation

1. Install or use a Python version compatible with the project requirements. (`3.12.3` works)
2. Clone the GitHub repository to your local device.
3. Move your current working directory to the repository folder.
4. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Execute `src/main.py`.

Once you execute the Python file, you will be greeted with a request to enter your bot's Discord token, which will be stored in `secrets.json`. On all future executions, this will no longer appear (of course).

## Personal Narrative

I have wanted to create this bot for months, but I decided not to so that I wasn't forcing my ideas on others. One day, a friend from the server expressed their desire for a Shavian equaivalent of a fun typing test in a Discord bot. I shared my interest in it too, and realized -- this is probably the time I should finally make a bot, not just with the typing test, but with other features the server may find useful.
