# Corpus Information

The corpus is derived from **MonkeyType**'s source, which can be found [here](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/tree/master/frontend/static/languages). A helper function is then used to help transliterate the standard English orthography into Shavian, which can then be cleaned up.
